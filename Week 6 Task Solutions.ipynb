    "## Tasks for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python function that takes a date, for example, \"2024-02-12\", and returns the list of articles for that day.\n",
    "2. Write some code that explores whether the fields \"abstract\" and \"snippet\" are always the same or they differ. Which one has more information?\n",
    "3. Write a function that given one article (in its nested structure), creates a flat dictionary with keys that are relevant for analysis: either the abstract or snippet (see point 2); lead paragraph; headline; keywords concatenated via semicolon; pub_date; document_type; section_name; and type_of_material\n",
    "4. Write another function that calls the function from point 3 on every article, to create a list of article dictionaries, and convert this list into a dataframe and then store it as a CSV file with the date-month in the title (this is important for point 5 below).\n",
    "5. Once you have done all of these in the notebook, create a Python script that can be called with a date (from a TikTok video). First, the script looks whether a CSV with cleaned articles is in our folder. If not, calls first the API function to get the articles and then the function that converts them into a CSV. Then, it loads the CSV into a datafram and it uses filtering to get the articles for the desired date. These articles will be used for the Semantic Similarity portion of the TikTok Project."
