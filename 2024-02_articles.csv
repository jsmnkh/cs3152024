Help! I Missed a Cruise and the Cruise Line’s Own Travel Insurance Won’t Pay.,"After graduating from college in 2022 and working for a year, I used my bonus and some of my savings to book a nine-day Mediterranean cruise on Norwegian Cruise Line for my partner and me. Our $7,657 cruise package included airfare from Atlanta to Barcelona, Spain, via Newark, and Norwegian’s own BookSafe Travel Protection Plan, which included travel insurance and also allowed me to “cancel for any reason” for a 75 percent credit. Weather delayed our first flight, we missed the connection, and United Airlines could not get us to Barcelona in time to embark. I called Norwegian and agents suggested I buy last-minute tickets on a different airline, but I don’t have that kind of money. And even if I did, there were no direct flights to later ports, and I was unwilling to risk missing another connecting flight. So we spent the night in the Newark airport, paid for a return flight to Atlanta the next morning and canceled the cruise and remaining air legs. I got $1,184 back right away from Norwegian, and then an additional $232 back (for my return flight) from travel insurance when I filed a trip delay claim, but a trip cancellation claim for the cruise was denied outright. I feel I should at least get the 75 percent credit — otherwise what was the protection plan for? Can you help?

What to Watch This Weekend: Come Home to ‘Expats’,"“Prestige TV” is often synonymous with “show about rich people being sad,” and by that metric, “Expats” (Amazon Prime Video) is easily among the most prestigious shows.

"T’s Valentine’s Day Gift Guide: Floral Cookware, Scented Matches and More","In the winter months, I tend to favor candlelight over electricity in the evenings. If I have to endure the season’s early sunsets and freezing temperatures, at least I can make it cozy (and complexion-flattering) inside. Scented candles can grow cloying after a few hours, so I prefer scented matches — they still lend a sense of occasion to lighting up, but their smell won’t linger long enough to give you a headache. The yuzu incense matches from Hibi are my favorite — the brand was created by Kobe Match Company, which has been producing matches in Japan since 1929. Each one lasts about 10 minutes, and a pad for safe burning is included in the box. I also like Bohème’s Marisol fragrance — its notes of cardamom, clove and sandalwood are infused into extra-long matchsticks. For a touch of old-world charm, Buly is a classic choice: The brand’s perfumed matches come in eight signature scents and are housed in beautifully illustrated boxes. Any of these options would make a charming Valentine’s Day gift paired with a whimsical candle from Wednesday Company. Handmade by the Bronx-based Grace Battista, these playful depictions of croissants, baguettes and fruit look good enough to eat. And they’re unscented, so you can enjoy them long into the night.",Cookware;Jewels and Jewelry;Tea;Valentine's Day;Design;Tableware;Tomatoes;Candles;Ceramics and Pottery;Gifts,2024-02-01T20:07:10+0000,article,T Magazine,News,What T Magazine editors are coveting for ourselves and eyeing for our loved ones.

New York Distilling Company Moves Down the L Line,"New York Distilling Company, one of the oldest craft distilleries in New York City, is moving and introducing a new whiskey. Opened in 2011, this distillery made Williamsburg, Brooklyn, its home until last year. In March it will open a new facility, three times the size of the original, in Bushwick. The new distillery will open for 90-minute tours, with a fee and reservations required, beginning on March 1; it will eventually open a new public cocktail bar and tasting room, but it will not be called the Shanty, as it was in Williamsburg. In addition, it is retiring its longstanding Ragtime Rye and replacing it with Jaywalk. The new rye is distilled from Horton rye, a grain varietal with roots dating back to 17th-century New York that the distillery has nurtured, growing it in the Finger Lakes region, over the past eight years. “This is the rye we have been dreaming of for 13 years,” said Allen Katz, the distillery’s co-founder. Three ryes will be bottled under the Jaywalk label: straight rye, a blend of 6-, 7- and 8-year-old ryes and 92 proof ($50 for 750 milliliters); bonded rye, 100 proof ($55 for 750 milliliters); and heirloom rye, cask strength, so named because it’s made from 100 percent Horton rye ($119 for a 700 milliliters). The new whiskies are robust and complex in their flavor, not merely spicy like many ryes. They will all be available starting Feb. 15 from Bottlerocket, in Manhattan, Brooklyn Wine Exchange and Gnarly Vines, in Brooklyn, and online.

Just this past year he opened three, and he is about to add another for a total of 12 at various levels of service and price. The newest one, open later this week, is his first that is not rooted in his native Mexico or even Cuba, like his Cuban-style diner, Coppelia. It is Italian. “My cooking background is French, my restaurants are Mexican but there’s a place in my heart for Italian,” he said. “I’m ready to cook my own interpretation.” His ode to Italy, named for the Italian sour cherry, looks to Roman cooking and that of coastal areas. It has moved into the Upper East Side townhouse space occupied until last year by the Simone. But unlike the garden-level predecessor, his restaurant, with 60 seats, will occupy two floors and will add a bar in the almost summery setting with light colors accented with green downstairs. Upstairs, a more opulent room is done in a ruby palette; both areas will offer the same menu. Louis Skibar, a frequent partner, is a co-owner. To begin, the restaurant will serve dinner featuring various supplì, like arancini; baked clams with salsa verde; bucatini carbonara with duck guanciale and duck eggs; pappardelle with Sunday gravy and beef cheeks; and suckling pig agrodolce. Soon, there will be breakfast with panini and classic Italian pastries like sfogliatelle, and lunch.

Beaux imported exotic ingredients from around the world, concocting a mix of more than 80 different notes, including jasmine and May rose harvested from Grasse, France; ylang-ylang flowers from Madagascar; Brazilian tonka beans; and sandalwood. Months later, he presented Chanel with an array of aromatic vials, and she chose the one labeled five. When Beaux asked her what she’d call the perfume, she said, “I present my dress collections on May 5, the fifth day of the fifth month of the year, and so we will let it keep the number it has, and this number will bring it good luck.”","Jewels and Jewelry;Perfumes and Fragrances;Fashion and Apparel;Chanel SA;Chanel, Coco",2024-02-07T10:00:57+0000,article,T Magazine,News,The accessory — which doubles as a diamond ring — takes its inspiration from the design of the iconic perfume bottle.

The Best Laughs on ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ Have Always Been Larry’s Own,"As the creator and star of “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” Larry David has been ambling in and out of view for almost 25 years, playing a version of himself whose odyssey is now winding to a close: This month, the show began its 12th and final season, concluding a run that started in the last days of the Clinton administration.

Rome Finally Gets the Modern Hotels It Deserves,"While Rome’s charms may be, as they say, eternal, it’s never been a city particularly prized for its hotels. Until recently, upmarket lodging in the Italian capital usually meant an ostentatiously decorated pile meant to evoke the city’s 16th- and 17th-century palazzi, stuffed with gilded furniture and vague nostalgia.

The Bulgari hotel, for example, opened last summer in a hulking 1930s government building designed by the prominent Trieste-born architect Vittorio Ballio Morpurgo. And the Edition hotel moved into a bank partly attributed to Marcello Piacentini, the architect responsible for the EUR district, the neighborhood of massive edifices constructed under Mussolini.

Why We’re Living in an Age of Twins,"THE GREAT LOVE (or should I say, loves) of my preadolescent years in India was a pair of identical Danish twins. Charlotte and Christina were the most exotic things the British School in New Delhi had ever seen. They appeared like two beams of Nordic sunshine during those final days of India’s Socialist isolation in 1990 — blond, elfin, androgynous and (it has to be said) tantalizingly interchangeable. Charlotte was the extroverted one, impish, funny; Christina was quieter, a touch glacial. I was a Charlotte man, but went out briefly with Christina, which may have only meant a few slow dances to Guns N’ Roses’ 1991 hit “November Rain.” I was aware even then, at that age when so much is felt and so little articulated, of there being something compelling in giving my tween heart to one twin while going out with her double. Identical twins have it rough. As soon as we see them, fetishizing their likenesses and dissimilarities, we turn them into proxies for ideas. We revel in our ability to tell them apart, as if it were up to us to impart individuality unto them. We marvel at the sureness of our eye, treating them like human trompe l’oeils. We hardly stop to consider the actual reality of identical twins before extracting metaphorical power from them. There lies a chasm between biological fact and the captivating game of mirroring and doubling that we, as humans, love to play, where likeness has the inverse effect of drawing attention to deeper differences.",Twins;Books and Literature;Dead Ringers (TV Program);Doppelganger: A Trip Into the Mirror World (Book);May December (Movie),2024-02-12T10:00:50+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Mirroring, mimicking and doubling are everywhere these days.

Ryan Chon and Camdyn Healey are the chefs in charge. The items likely to be served on beautiful little plates, blocks of glass and the like will depend on seaweed “caviar,” charred king oyster mushrooms, tofu with chile crisp, smoked carrot tartare, udon noodles with miso, and shredded hearts of palm.

"Tubi Is Reviving a Lost Joy: Watching Really, Really Bad Movies","There’s a 2008 movie that offers an odd preview of today’s entertainment. In Michel Gondry’s “Be Kind Rewind,” a bizarre accident demagnetizes the entire inventory of a video rental store, so a clerk and his eccentric friend decide to remake all the films themselves, from “The Lion King” to “Driving Miss Daisy” to “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Their versions are 20 minutes long (at most), shot on an old hand-held video camera and produced in a delightfully quirky, ad hoc way: handcrafted props and sets, buddies working as extras, costumes from the local dry cleaner. They call their tapes “Sweded,” explaining the time it takes to supply films by claiming the copies have to be imported from Scandinavia. In Gondry’s fantasy, the community responds well to this homespun cinema: Not only does demand go up, but store patrons begin to participate in making the movies. Gondry’s theory, he has said, was that “people would enjoy films better if they shot them themselves.”","Video Recordings, Downloads and Streaming;Social Media;Tubi Inc;Movies",2024-02-14T10:02:32+0000,article,Magazine,News,Their films have gone viral for their awful production values.

Why Wellness Culture Has Cozied Up to Leeches,"The average patient today, confronted with the prospect of using a medicinal leech, or Hirudo medicinalis, a faceless aquatic invertebrate with a lust for blood, might feel some queasiness, if not outright repulsion.

And in medieval and early modern Europe, when impure blood was believed to unbalance the humors of the body and cause disease, the creatures were seen as solicitous helpers, ever ready to relieve a patient of their unwelcome plasma. As the British medical historians Robert G.W. Kirk and Neil Pemberton wrote in their 2013 book, “Leech,” the worms were long celebrated as a gentle alternative to the lancet and became known, during the so-called leech mania of the early 19th century, as “the tools of the physician who cared.” In 1828, the French hospital system alone prescribed tens of millions of leeches, for conditions ranging from insomnia to smallpox.",Leeches;Blood;Alternative and Complementary Medicine,2024-02-16T18:12:56+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"The bloodsucking worms might conjure an era of vampiric pseudoscience, but their powerful jaws are inspiring new applications."

Yoga and Energy Healing in a Former Hudson Valley Mansion,"When the Ranch at Malibu opened in 2010 as a luxury health resort on 200 acres in California’s Santa Monica Mountains, its approach was somewhat radical: Guests signed up for a full week of group hikes, fitness classes, spa treatments, nutrition consults and communal, organic meals without caffeine, gluten, soy or dairy. The goal, says its founder Alex Glasscock, was “for people to mentally and physically reset and recharge.” On April 15, a second location, the Ranch at Hudson Valley, is scheduled to open near Tuxedo Park, N.Y., in a slate-and-stone lakefront mansion surrounded by state parks. Glasscock hopes the 25-room property, which he describes as “like a big, luxury dorm,” will facilitate connections between those who stay. Guests will do yoga under the ornate plaster ceiling of the former ballroom and, in Glasscock’s ideal world, come to dinner in their pajamas and robes. This new outpost offers a few additional treatments including colonics and energy healings — which incorporate techniques such as hypnosis and sound therapy. In winter, guests can sled or snowshoe, and in summer there’s paddleboarding on the lake. The Ranch has also relaxed a few of the restrictions: You can book three nights at the Hudson Valley property instead of the seven required in Malibu, and, in concession to the most common request of all, caffeine is no longer taboo — organic Nicaraguan coffee is served at breakfast in both locations.

She buys gifts for him to take to her mother and older sister and sweeps the street in front of her workplace with gusto. But he comes and goes without seeing her, “afraid to look his daughter in the eye.” He’s there only to sign a new promissory note with her employer borrowing more money against her labor, which is sex work.","Books and Literature;Carpenter, Juliet Winters;A Woman of Pleasure (Book);Murata, Kiyoko",2024-02-26T10:00:15+0000,article,Books,Review,"“A Woman of Pleasure,” Kiyoko Murata’s first novel to be translated into English, explores the world of sex work in early-20th-century Japan."

A Watch With an Irresistible Tick,"Time ticks by silently but, in the arcane universe of mechanical watches, sound is the ultimate achievement. While chiming clocks were pioneered in the 1600s, it wasn’t until the late 19th century that the apparatus was perfected in miniature. Squeezing in the more than 100 additional components necessary to have a modern-style wristwatch strike with pinpoint accuracy and rich, clear peals — each watch sounds subtly different — is considered the height of horological craft, and most companies abandoned such complex models long ago. But a few holdouts continue to make such timepieces. Among them is Omega, whose new numbered-edition Speedmaster marries the Swiss brand’s stopwatch chronograph feature with a minute repeater, enabling wearers to press a button that triggers a series of tones to signal the minutes, tens of seconds and seconds. The unique combination, housed in an 18-karat gold case with an aventurine dial and rose guilloche subdials, is arrestingly beautiful while ringing every bell.

"Against All Odds, New York’s Artist Buildings Have Survived","New York’s reputation as a beacon for artists was never inevitable. Only after World War II had destabilized Europe was the city able to usurp Paris as the commercial center of the art business. Veterans returning from abroad found a new diversity of college art programs and art schools thanks to the abundance of federal education grants made available by the G.I. Bill. The expansion of government-subsidized housing loans meant that cheap space was also easy to come by, as New York had a then-ample stock of residential and industrial buildings. In the following decades, which saw the birth of Abstract Expressionism, followed by Pop Art, followed by minimalism — all locally grown movements — the city also became the capital of what we now call the art world, a multibillion-dollar, mostly unregulated global economy of galleries, auction houses and fairs that has grown without interruption through wars, recessions and two pandemics.","Art;Photography;Real Estate and Housing (Residential);Income Inequality;Brooklyn Army Terminal (Brooklyn, NY);Rossin, Rachel (1987- );Brooklyn (NYC);New York City",2024-02-26T10:03:03+0000,article,T Magazine,News,"Generations of creatives once flocked to the city seeking affordable rent.

A Designer’s Endlessly Versatile Clothes,"Growing up in North London, Charlie Constantinou was a serious piano student who aspired to a career as a composer. But when, as a teenager, he landed a part-time job at a sneaker store, he became enamored with avant-garde streetwear by designers such as Jun Takahashi of Undercover and Nasir Mazhar — the latter of whom, like Constantinou, is a member of the city’s tight-knit Cypriot community. Soon, Constantinou was dreaming up a collection of his own. The creative process, says the Tottenham-based 25-year-old, felt surprisingly familiar: “It’s very much about world building; I get the same feeling from composition.” After studying design at London’s Central Saint Martins, he launched his namesake brand in 2022 when the influential retailers Ssense and H. Lorenzo bought pieces from his master’s degree collection. In the short time since, he’s developed a clearly defined style informed by both ancient history (spiral motifs taken from Cypriot ceramics) and futurism (astronaut-style boots), expressed largely through the use of quilted expandable nylon, a high-tech version of the textile that can stretch and contract to a dramatic degree. He’s drawn to the crinkly look of the fabric, and to the fact that it can accommodate a wide variety of body types: Many of his pieces are one size fits all and, while billed as men’s wear, are meant for people of all genders.","Fashion and Apparel;Jeans (Apparel);Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design;Constantinou, Charlie",2024-02-27T10:00:35+0000,article,T Magazine,News,The London-based Charlie Constantinou creates shape-shifting garments with zippers and detachable legs.

A House Where Old Miami Style Meets Old World Eclecticism,"IT CAN BE hard to tell in Miami what’s natural and what isn’t. The sky is often uncannily blue, the vegetation (palms, sea grapes, jacarandas) a startling green. The bright white sand on South Beach is Floridian but trucked in from mines to combat coastal erosion.

Why Are Grapes Suddenly Everywhere?,"Grapes have been associated with pleasure since ancient times, a symbol of Bacchus, the god of wine and revelry. These days, clusters of plummy Concords, oval autumn royals and dusky kyohos are decorating dinner tables, doubling as cornucopian decorations and low-effort snacks. “You can get a beautiful, imperfect drip and drape from grapes,” says the interior stylist Colin King, 35, who overflowed a marble urn with abundant mounds of them for the launch of his furniture collection, a collaboration with the Future Perfect, in New York this past fall. Although he uses green grapes for daytime parties, for evening events he prefers the “moody, sensual vibe” of dark varieties — like the attenuated, oblong moon drops that the artist Laila Gohar, 35, mixed with red globes and flames to form an edible monolith for the recent opening of the Essentiel Antwerp clothing store in New York. The chef Mina Stone, 42 — who runs Mina’s, the cafe at MoMA PS1 in Queens, and is a go-to caterer for art gallery dinners — favors Thomcords, a sweet, seedless hybrid she often serves with dessert to “provide heft and a colorful backdrop” for daintier confections. She also likes to roast grapes alongside seared duck breast. In London, the pastry chef Claire Ptak, the owner of Violet bakery, offers what she calls fragolina cupcakes, named for the fragola (Italian for “strawberry”) grapes that she cooks down, then purées and adds to the buttercream frosting. The fragolas “taste like a berryish Concord,” says Ptak, 49, who tops each cake with a small cluster of fruit. The frosted treats “transport you back to childhood when you take the first bite,” she says, “and then you realize they’re also very grown-up.” — Lauren Joseph","Sweden;Ptak, Claire;Gohar, Laila;Jewels and Jewelry;Grapes;Hotels and Travel Lodgings;Restaurants",2024-02-28T10:01:51+0000,article,T Magazine,News,Plus: a new dining destination with rooms for the night in the Swedish countryside and more from T’s cultural compendium.

Like Timothée Chalamet’s dashingly coifed hero — who steers monstrous sandworms over the desert like a charioteer — Villeneuve puts on a great show. The art of cinematic spectacle is alive and rocking in “Dune: Part Two,” and it’s a blast.","Movies;Dune: Part Two (Movie);Villeneuve, Denis;Butler, Austin (1991- );Chalamet, Timothee (1995- );Coleman, Zendaya;Herbert, Frank",2024-02-29T10:03:35+0000,article,Movies,Review,"Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya make an appealing pair in Denis Villeneuve’s follow-up film, and the actors fit together with tangible ease."

Sports Anchors Went All In on Outrage. Then There’s Scott Van Pelt.,"Scott Van Pelt materializes onscreen five nights a week at midnight — sometimes a little earlier or later — typically in a necktie and pocket square, the spotlight reflecting off his bald head, ready to talk about the day in sports. There will be highlights, analysis, commentary and, depending on when you tune in, maybe a funny bit. (On Mondays, he and his sidekick, Stanford Steve, deliver “Bad Beats,” a Letterman-style compilation of the plays behind the week’s most brutal gambling losses — the meaningless three-pointer at the buzzer that busted bettors on the “under,” the late fumble and pointless touchdown that prevented the winning team from “covering.”) Van Pelt likes to say that he just tries to be himself on air. If we take him at his word about that, it’s safe to say that he is thoughtful, wry, self-aware and occasionally sentimental. Also, that he is not aggressive, obnoxious or particularly opinionated, which makes him a rarity among today’s sports-media personalities.","Van Pelt, Scott;ESPN;Athletics and Sports;McAfee, Pat (1987- );Smith, Stephen A (1967- );Olbermann, Keith",2024-02-29T10:03:44+0000,article,Magazine,News,"If you’re tired of the endless manufactured arguments by modern sports personalities, his midnight “SportsCenter” is a safe harbor."

"Sure, It Won an Oscar. But Is It Criterion?","In October 2022, amid a flurry of media appearances promoting their film “Tàr,” the director Todd Field and the star Cate Blanchett made time to visit a cramped closet in Manhattan. This closet, which has become a sacred space for movie buffs, was once a disused bathroom at the headquarters of the Criterion Collection, a 40-year-old company dedicated to “gathering the greatest films from around the world” and making high-quality editions available to the public on DVD and Blu-ray and, more recently, through its streaming service, the Criterion Channel. Today Criterion uses the closet as its stockroom, housing films by some 600 directors from more than 50 countries — a catalog so synonymous with cinematic achievement that it has come to function as a kind of film Hall of Fame. Over four decades, through a combination of luck, obsession and good taste, this 55-person company has become the arbiter of what makes a great movie, more so than any Hollywood studio or awards ceremony.","Criterion Collection;Video Recordings, Downloads and Streaming;Movies;Collectors and Collections;ANDERSON, WES;Bay, Michael;Blanchett, Cate;Bowie, David;Gilliam, Terry;Reichardt, Kelly;Scorsese, Martin;Safdie, Josh;Safdie, Benny",2024-02-29T10:04:01+0000,article,Magazine,News,How the Criterion Collection became the film world’s arbiter of taste.

How Does a Day Job Affect an Artist’s Work? This Exhibition Has an Idea,"The Hawaii-born artist Toshiko Takaezu was known for her ceramic works that redefined the genre with their “closed forms,” as she called them — sealed vessels whose hidden interior spaces were meant to activate the imagination. Next month, Takaezu’s life and work will be the focus of a major retrospective at the Noguchi Museum in Long Island City, Queens. “Toshiko Takaezu: Worlds Within” will present over 150 pieces from private and public collections around the country, co-curated by the art historian Glenn Adamson, the museum curator Kate Wiener and the composer and sound artist Leilehua Lanzilotti. (A 368-page monograph, published in collaboration with Yale University Press, will accompany the exhibition.) Visitors will be able to see a collection that spans seven decades of Takaezu’s career, from her early student work in Hawaii in the 1940s to immersive, monumental ceramic forms she produced in the late 1990s to early 2000s. “Takaezu was also a weaver and painter, and often constructed multimedia installations where her ceramics, textiles and paintings operated together,” says Wiener. To play off this idea, the curators organized the show chronologically, incorporating each of these media into various sections, inspired by Takaezu’s own installations. Sound will also play a role. In her ceramic pieces, Takaezu would often place a dried fragment of clay within her closed form vessels, creating a musical rattle. For this exhibit, Lanzilotti (a finalist for the 2022 Pulitzer Prize in music) has developed a series of videos offering insight into the sonic elements of Takaezu’s work — and visitors can hear those rattles firsthand via an interactive display.
